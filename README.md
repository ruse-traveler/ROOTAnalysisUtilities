# ROOTAnalysisUtilities [Under Construction]

A library to streamline interacting with certain objects in ROOT6 and earlier,
especially graphical objects (i.e. things that can be drawn) and TNtuple's.

### To-Do
  - [] clean up WIP from BHCal pTDR
  - [] add histogram manager from PHENC
  - [] upgrade to cmake rather than compiling via cling
